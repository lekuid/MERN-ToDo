# Use
run npm start on both client and server to run the app on your localhost
port 5000 for the Express backend and 3000 for the React frontend.

# Idea
This is a very simple fullstack application created using Express, MongoDB, React and Nodejs in an attempt to learn the stack.
The whole app has been built ground up without reference, with inspiration derived from a YouTube video.
